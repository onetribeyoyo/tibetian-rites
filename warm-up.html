      <h2>1. Body Scan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lie flat on your back with your arms resting on the floor, palms facing up. Breathe in and out slowly and
            deeply several times.
        <li>Keeping your shoulders and buttocks in place, breathe in and press your abdomen upward lifting the small of
            your back off the floor.
        <li>Then breathe out, releasing your abdominal muscles so that the small of your back returns to a resting
            position on the floor.
        <li>As you do the exercise, mentally scan your body. Starting at your head and slowly working your way down,
            visit each part of the body, briefly focusing your attention there.
        <li>Each time you breathe in, become aware of tension and other sensations in the area where your attention is
            focused.
        <li>Each time you breathe out, release any tension you find and relax the area completely.

            while the back of your left hand slaps against the small of your back.
