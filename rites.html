      <h2>Rite #1</h2>
      <h3>Starting Positton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stand erect with arms outstretched, horizontal to the floor, palms facing down. Shoulders should not be hunched or
            tense, and your arms should be in line with your shoulders.
        <li>Picture a clock on the floor, under your feet, face up. When you begin to spin, turn in the same direction
            as the hands of the clock.
      </ul>
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn from left to right, spinning around in a complete circle. Begin and end slowly, building up speed and
            decelerating gradually. This prevents undue stress on the body. Breathe slowly and evenly as you spin.
        <li>You may become slightly dizzy. To alleviate this, focus your vision on a single point straight ahead of you
            before you begin spinning. As you turn, keep your eyes on that point as long as possible. When this point
            enters your field ofvision again, refocus on it.
        <li>When you are finished spinning, take a few deep breaths, breathing in and out through the nose. Relax your
            body. Lie down in preparation for Rite Number Two. Wait for any lingering dizziness to disappear. Do not
            begin the next rite until you feel completely back in balance.
      </ul>

      <h2>Rite #2</h2>
      <h3>Starting Positton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lie flat on the floor, legs extended, face up. It's best to do this on a thick carpet, an exercise mat, or
            some sort of padded suface to cushion the spine and avoid contact with a cold floor.
        <li>Place your arms close to your sides, parallel to your body, palms against the floor, fingers together.
      </ul>
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Breathe in through your nose as you raise your head offthe floor, tucking your chin against your chest. At
            the same time, lift both legs up together, bringing them as close to vertical as you can.
        <li>It is important to keep your legs as straight as possible. If you are unable to keep your legs perfectly
            straight, let your knees bend only as much as is absolutely necessary..Work towards being able to raise your
            legs without bending your knees.
        <li>Slowly lower your head and your legs back to the floor at the same time, still trying to keep your legs as
            straight as possible. Breathe out gently through your nose as you do this.
        <li>Allow all your muscles to relax for a moment and then repeat this movement.
      </ul>

      <h3>Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Breathe out through your nose as you gently roll your head and neck forward, tucking your chin against your
            chest.
        <li>Breathe in slowly and deeply as you lean backward, angling your torso over your lower legs. As your spine
            arches, your head follows, bending back gently as far as it can go.
        <li>Breathe out and return to your starting position. Breathe in and repeat.

      <h2>Rite #4</h2>
      <h3>Starting Positton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sit on the floor, spine straight, legs fully extended in front of you, feet apart about the width of your
            shoulders.
        <li>Place the palms of your hands down on the floor, alongside your buttocks, arms straight, fingers pointing
            toward your toes. Breathe in.
      </ul>
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Breathe out and tuck your chin down against your chest. Breathe in again slowly as you let your head sink
            back as far as it will naturally go. Raise your torso up as you continue this slow, deep inhalation. Your
            torso will be supported by your arms and lower legs. Your knees should be bent, positioned over your ankles,
            your arms straight, perpendicular to the floor. Your chest, abdomen, and upper legs should form a bridge
            or arch.Your feet should be flat on the floor.
        <li>In this position, tense every muscle in your body and hold your breath. Then breathe out, gradually and
        thoroughly emprying your lungs as you relax every muscle and return to the original, starting position.
        <li>Rest a moment, breathe in, then repeat.
      </ul>

      <h2>Rite #5</h2>
      <h3>Starting Positton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin by lying face dowa with your legs extended and your toes curled under.Your hands should be placed
            directly under your shoulders with your palms down.Your feet should be spaced apart more or less the width
            of your shoulders, in line with your hands, so as to give you a solid base.
        <li>Lift your body, including your legs, by fully extending your arms perpendicular to the floor and flexing
            your toes. This position resembles a modified push-up; your spine should be arched, your chest raised, and
            your lower back in a sagging position.
      </ul>
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Slowly breathe in through your nose as you gently move your head back as far as possible.
        <li>Continue breathing in as you bend at the hips, bringing your body up into an inverted V. As you move into
            this position, your head will naturally come forward. Tuck your chin against your chest so you can see your
            feet, which are now almost flat on the floor with only your heels slightly raised.
        <li>Breathe out, thoroughly emprying your lungs as you return to the arched position with your arms and legs
            straight. Breathe in and repeat.
      </ul>
